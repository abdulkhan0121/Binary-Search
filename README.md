# Binary Search

Perform a binary search using Javaâ€™s built-in binary search method in the Arrays class to see
if the item exists in the list, if so output the index.

Then write your two more binary search methods, one recursive and one iterative. Then
demo each binary search on the sorted array, counting the number of probes made, and output
that result. A probe is counted as a comparison between the element sought and an element in
the array.*/
